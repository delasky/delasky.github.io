<p>The tagline/idea for our app was "two dimensional reddit" and a major inspiration for me was New York Magazine's Culture Grid.  The idea is that you would be able to rank and vote on items and concepts based on multiple scales. Two of these scales would be displayed at any given time, so you could visualize all the items or concepts in your category on a cartesian graph. I got the idea from the many conversations I've had with my girlfriend about how to get home from various parts of the city. There is always a debate about whether we should Uber or take Muni. It's easy to say that Uber is "better" than Muni, but it's not in all ways: Muni is cheaper, and Uber is lazier. Biking isn't "better" or "worse" than either, it's healthier but less convenient. Anyway, that was the pitch! The idea was an app where Users could vote existing items up and down and right on left on the various scales being displayed, then switch scales and see the items revisualized. Then they could add their own items, scales or even whole categories. In it's final iteration I could see users being able to create their own private graphs, making it a fun way for a large group to decide where to go on vacation, or where to go to dinner, or which movie to see, etc. </p>

<p>We didn't get all that done in a weekend! We weren't even able to get to voting, which was (for me at least) a big part of our MVP. But that's why it's called the "minimal" viable product, and I'm proud of what we did get done.</p>

<p>We used Rails to create an API, serving JSON to an Angular app. We used a javascript library called Raphael to put together our visuals. The biggest challenges for me were dealing with Angular, which I barely knew before the project started, and trying to learn the super fun but minimally documented Raphael and g.Raphael libraries. As always, time management was a huge issue and what should have been minor bugs ended up taking a huge chunk for our time. This was also only the second time I've deployed to heroku and there were some major bugs there. Still, this was by far one of my favorite experiences in class. After so many class projects designed to practice some specific skill, getting to use that knowledge on our own project was amazing, and working with my talented teammates <a href="https://github.com/jplouie">Jeff</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kixton">Kim</a> was its own reward.</p>
