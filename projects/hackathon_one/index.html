<p><a href="http://flight-calendar-2946.herokuapp.com/">Flmbrrcl.io</a> (previously known as Untitled Flight Calendar Project). </p>
<p>I worked on this project with a classmate of mine, Dev Sethi. It's the first thing I ever built start to finish that lives complete on the internet. It was a fantastic experience.</p>
<p>Dev had the idea to create an app that could update your calendar with the minimum possible information about your travel plans: your flight number. We searched high and low for APIs we could use to get the flight number, arrival and departure times we would be using but we couldn't find anything publically available. So we built our own!</p>
<p> When you put a Flight Number into Flmbrrcl.io, our backend searches google for that flight number. Using a gem called Nokogiri, we scrape all the text from that search result and parse it with some Regex, basically using Google's amazing "knowledge boxes" as the source for our arrival and departure times and airports. We then use this information to create an .ics file which we offer to the user as a download, as well as a JSON object which we use to display the data in a knowledge box of our own.</p>
<p> The project was a great way to familiarize ourselves with some of the darker nooks and crannies of the Ruby-verse, such as webscraping and File I/O. Although it looks simple there is some genuinely cool stuff going on under the hood. In addition to building our own API, we built a system to delete old .ics files from our server after they were generated. It was also great to build something that actually lives on the web. Anyone in the world can go to our little site and actually use it (although there are some minor accuracy issues owing to the fact that flight numbers change  more often then we were aware before we started this project).</p>
<p>I'm sure in time I'll look back on this project and cringe a little bit, but for now I am a proud papa. And I am going to keep it as a public part of my portfolio so that I can always look back on it and see where I started.</p>
