<h2>Best ways to react to a friends good tweet</h2>
<h3>by Daniel Olasky</h3>
<h4>January 20, 2014</h4>
<p>
	I think we've all been there. We have a friend IRL who makes a good tweet online. Maybe it a tweet that makes you laugh. Maybe its a tweet that makes you cry. It could be either one, it doesn't really matter. The point is that it makes you say, "This is a good tweet."
</p>
<p>
	There are three ways to show your friend that you think their tweet is good:
</p>
<h5>
	Tell your friend, <b>"Good tweet!"</b> with your voice, in person.
</h5>
<p>
	This is a good way to let your friend (or pal or buddy) know that you thought your tweet was good, and also that you are keeping tabs on them online. This is good! This is a good thing you should do for good tweets.
</p>
<h5><b>Retweet</b> or <b>Quote</b> their tweet.</h5>
<p>This is weird. Why would you do that? This is obviously awkward and weird. Yeah, hold on, lemme just RETWEET that. Ridiculous. You will be laughed at.</p>
<h5>Reply to their tweet saying <b>"This is a good tweet."</b></h5>
<p>Obviously, this is the best way to let a friend know that you like their good tweet.</p>
