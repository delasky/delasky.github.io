Yes, there are some disadvantages. You must generally be in the same room, and in fact, within the same personal space, as the person you want to convey the information to. Pretty much everyone else in the room will know a secret message is being conveyed. And also, whispers can sometimes be garbled.</p><p>But, in some other key areas, whispering is super great! There is no paper trail for a whisper. I guess that is the one keyest area. </p></body></head></html>
