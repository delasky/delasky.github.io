Secret messages are a great way to convey secret information to your friends, family, colleagues or assets in a way that can't be detected by your other friends, family, colleagues or enemies!

There are a lot of super sweet ways to pass secret messages.

**Invisible Ink!**

Make sure you practice your penmanship

**Codes!**

Bone up on your math!

**Microfilm!**

You may have seen this in a library or museum and it is super awesome!

For me though, Daniel Olasky, right here right now, the best way to conver secret messages is through <b>whispering</b>. Yes, there are some disadvantages. You must generally be in the same room, and in fact, within the same personal space, as the person you want to convey the information to. Pretty much everyone else in the room will know a secret message is being conveyed. And also, whispers can sometimes be garbled.

But, in some other key areas, whispering is super great! There is no paper trail for a whisper. I guess that is the one keyest area.
