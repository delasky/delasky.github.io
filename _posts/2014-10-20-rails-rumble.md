title: Rails Rumble Hackathon
---

I spent the weekend working on another hackathon with my classmates. This one was fun because it wasn't just a class project, we were competing in the Rails Rumble, which meant that real live people in the universe might see what we were working on! 

One of the things I'm proud of is that this was something that we students really took the lead on putting together. We had a big brainstorming session where we listed ideas we wanted to work on, broke ourselves into teams, and planned out our apps. When they saw how excited we were about this, the people at MakerSquare did a great job of providing support by opening up the office for us on the weekend.
