title: building a text based player tracker
---


I had this idea kicking around for a tool or app that would make it super easy to learn what your favorite baseball players did in last nights game. 

Let's say there are a few baseball players you like. Did you know that during the summer they play baseball games pretty much every day? It's ridiculous. Lets say that you want a quick way to see what your favorite player did in his game last night. You could look up the box score of the game, or use a fantasy baseball player tracker to show you the stats of your player.

A lot of baseball people find these numbers soothing, but there sure are a lot of them! Wouldn't it be easier if instead of seeing all the stats, you could just choose which stats you cared about, and then read a sentence like "Last night, Miguel Cabrera struck out twice and got an RBI."

What if you could do the same thing for five different players, in five different sports! You could pretty much have your own custom sports page, delivering EXACTLY the sports news you want. You could track exactly the stats you want, for exactly the players and teams you care about, all delivered in a way to get the information from the screen into your brain as quickly and frictionlessly as possible.

Anyway, here is [step 1](http://delasky.github.io/project-engine). All it does so far is spit out a sentence based on the stats you choose, but I wrote the script that does it from scratch and building this protoype involved playing with local storage and a lot of other stuff that I had to figure out at the university of Google.
