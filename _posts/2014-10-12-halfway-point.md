title: At The Halfway Point

It's kind of crazy to think about the fact that our  program is more then halfway over. It feels like the last few weeks have gone by in the blink of an eye.

At the same time it feels like a lifetime.

When we started the class they told us that we would be stunned by how much we've learned, and I think that's true. I remember my struggles with our first project, trying to get basic SQL queries to return class instances, and now think about throwing together polymorphic associations in Active Record, it's hard to believe how far we've come.

I've learned so much, but the biggest difference between the Daniel of Mid-October and the Daniel of early September is attitudinal. In a program like this you really get thrown in the deep end, and I spent the first few weeks barely keeping my chin above water. I was so worried about my progress in the class, about absorbing all the information, I was just trying to survive. Now however, I'm actively seeking out new challenges. I am still a rank beginner in the grand scheme of things, and I know that my learning will continue for the rest of my life, but I have gained the confidence to believe that I _can_ learn the solutions to the problem. I'm confident that given any problem, I can dig into the documentation, do some reading, ask a few questions, and _figure out a path to a solution_. It certainly won't be  effortless, but I also know it won't be impossible.

I'm doing a hackathon next weekend with a few of my classmates and I am thrilled to get started on it, even though I have no idea how we will execute our idea yet. We were discussing our final class project, and instead of worring about being overwhelmed, I was actively seeking out new technologies to throw into the mix.

One last tiny thing: I'm writing this post in Vim. It's a little thing, and a Markdown file is about as easy as it gets, but I want to learn so I'm practicing. A few weeks ago I would have laughed at the idea of using Vim. Why bother when I have Sublime Text? Why make things harder on myself? Why not stick with the tried and true?

The truth is I want to learn Vim because its there. What better reason could you need?
