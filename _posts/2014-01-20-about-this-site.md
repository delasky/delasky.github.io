This was the first thing we ever worked on in my part-time front end class, which means its the first thing I ever built on the web. It uses jekyll to build the templates and manage the content. As you can see, I spent most of my time doing dumb stuff like trying to figure out how to use the border image css property to make the content display in my forehead because I am an idiot.
